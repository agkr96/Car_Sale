        <p id="intro"> Most of car companies and points to what future automobiles might be like. One day, such small,
            electric vehicles might safely shuttle people around, especially in crowded cities.

            Scientists and engineers are finding new ways to make cars safer, smarter and more efficient, or use less
            energy. New cars may help you keep track of your health by reminding you to take medication. If it’s
            electric, your car may send you a text reminding you to plug it in. Cars will talk to other cars, your
            computer, your phone and almost any other device. They’ll help drivers save energy, watch out for other
            drivers and avoid pedestrians.

            This is the future of automobiles: safer, smarter and more energy-conscious. As an added bonus, they might
            even drive themselves down the highway or through a city. You can sit back and enjoy the ride. </p>

        <h3>LUXURY CARS </h3>
        <p>A luxury vehicle provides increased levels of comfort, equipment, amenities, quality, performance, and status
            relative to regular cars for an increased price.

            The term is subjective and reflects both the qualities of the car and the brand image of its
            manufacturer. Luxury brands rank above premium brands, though there is no fixed demarcation between
            the two.

            Traditionally, most luxury cars were large vehicles, though smaller sports-oriented models were always
            produced. "Compact" luxury vehicles such as hatchbacks, and off-road capable sport utility vehicles, are
            relatively modern trends.</p>
        <h3>SUV CARS</h3>
        <p> Sport utility vehicles(SUV) currently in production (as of 2013) as well as past models. The list
            includes crossover SUVs, Mini SUVs, Compact SUVs and other similar vehicles. Also includes hybrid, luxury,
            sport or tuned, military, electric and fuel cell versions. Due to confusion[clarification needed], Sport
            Utility Trucks are also in this list.

            Many of the vehicles (both current and past) are related to other vehicles in the list. A vehicle
            listed as a 'past model' may still be in production in an updated form under a different name, it may be
            listed under that name in the 'currently in production' section. Also, some vehicles are sold under
            different marques in different geographical locations, therefore some vehicles may be listed more than once
            but usually link to the same page. Different states may also classify vehicles differently. What may be
            considered an SUV in one state, may not in another state. Example; The Chevrolet Nafees is known as the
            Chevrolet Zeeyan in Russia and Brazil, and in Australia and New Zealand, it is marketed by GM Holden (Holden
            Trax). Some images provided below may be pictures of outdated models.</p>
        <h3>ECONOMY CARS</h3>
        <p>Economy car is a term mostly used in the United States for cars designed for low-cost purchase and
            operation. Typical economy cars are small (compact or subcompact), lightweight, and inexpensive to
            buy. Economy car designers are forced by stringent design constraints to be inventive. Many
            innovations in automobile design were originally developed for economy cars, such as the Ford Model
            T and the Austin Mini. The alternative approach, other than innovating to build a low-cost
            car, is to build a stripped-down, no-frills version of a conventional car.

            Gordon Murray, the Formula 1 and McLaren F1 designer, said when designing his new Murray T.25 city car: "I
            would say that building a car to sell for six thousand pounds and designing that for a high-volume
            production, where you have all the quality issues under control, is a hundred times more difficult than
            designing a McLaren F1, or even a racing car. It is certainly the biggest challenge I've ever had from a
            design point of view."</p>
